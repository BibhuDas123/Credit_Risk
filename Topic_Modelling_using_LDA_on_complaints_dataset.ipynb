I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back.

Their systems, processes and management style are extremely inefficient and incompetency is a severe problem with even the smallest of requests. I would not and will not be recommending them. Sadly, the issue isn't with customer service ( they've been extremely helpful ) it is with US Bank 's nonsensical and inefficient procedures and company organization. \\n\\nHere is my story : On XX/XX/2019, I sent a request to US Bank to send me my credit from DC 's Tax and Revenue office. I called them to confirm receipt of my request and was told that it had been received and a research request had been opened. I would receive my refund by XX/XX/XXXX. I called US Bank several times from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to check in and was reassured that they had all the information that they needed from me and that they were working on getting my refund. No worries. \\n\\nI called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that there were NO updates to the research. Their Tax Team reassured me that they had made a request and that someone would get the request fulfilled. However, when I spoke to the Adjustment Team at DC 's Tax Office NO ONE from US Bank had sent a request for a refund. When I questioned the rep from the Escalation team about this, they weren't able to explain. The rep called DC 's Tax Office herself and was given instruction on how to file a request for credit with their office. They simply need to send a request in writing via email. Over four months and US Bank was NOW doing the supposed research to figure out the process for requesting a refund - it wasn't even someone on their research team. What was even more frustrating was that the Escalation rep couldn't do anything with the information she received other than put a note on my request for this so called \" research team ''. This is a waste of time for myself, the Rep and this research team. The rep should have been able to send this request herself or send me to someone who could get this handled IMMEDIATELY. \\n\\nSo now its over four months and I'm still waiting on them to send this email. There isn't even a process for resolving and expediting an outstanding issue like mine where it's clear that they were in the wrong. I've had to reach out to several Audit Managers via XXXX because there are no accessible contact information other than the generic customer service email. \\n\\nNo one has called to apologize and/or help me. I am regretful having to use them as my mortgage company. I would not recommend them and highly suggest going for a bank that cares about thoughtful management and processes and most importantly about immediate service.</td>\n",

When he refused to acknowledge that he was a collector he hung up on me. I called back and after 3 times of calling back, someone finally answered without hanging up. I advised to the company that I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB. No one mini Mirandized me either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...

              "10880  After my experience banking with US Bank, I can say that I do not trust them to service my mortgage loans. Their systems, processes and management style are extremely inefficient and incompetency is a severe problem with even the smallest of requests. I would not and will not be recommending them. Sadly, the issue isn't with customer service ( they've been extremely helpful ) it is with US Bank 's nonsensical and inefficient procedures and company organization. \\n\\nHere is my story : On XX/XX/2019, I sent a request to US Bank to send me my credit from DC 's Tax and Revenue office. I called them to confirm receipt of my request and was told that it had been received and a research request had been opened. I would receive my refund by XX/XX/XXXX. I called US Bank several times from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to check in and was reassured that they had all the information that they needed from me and that they were working on getting my refund. No worries. \\n\\nI called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that there were NO updates to the research. Their Tax Team reassured me that they had made a request and that someone would get the request fulfilled. However, when I spoke to the Adjustment Team at DC 's Tax Office NO ONE from US Bank had sent a request for a refund. When I questioned the rep from the Escalation team about this, they weren't able to explain. The rep called DC 's Tax Office herself and was given instruction on how to file a request for credit with their office. They simply need to send a request in writing via email. Over four months and US Bank was NOW doing the supposed research to figure out the process for requesting a refund - it wasn't even someone on their research team. What was even more frustrating was that the Escalation rep couldn't do anything with the information she received other than put a note on my request for this so called \" research team ''. This is a waste of time for myself, the Rep and this research team. The rep should have been able to send this request herself or send me to someone who could get this handled IMMEDIATELY. \\n\\nSo now its over four months and I'm still waiting on them to send this email. There isn't even a process for resolving and expediting an outstanding issue like mine where it's clear that they were in the wrong. I've had to reach out to several Audit Managers via XXXX because there are no accessible contact information other than the generic customer service email. \\n\\nNo one has called to apologize and/or help me. I am regretful having to use them as my mortgage company. I would not recommend them and highly suggest going for a bank that cares about thoughtful management and processes and most importantly about immediate service.  ...
